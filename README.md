Throttling

Throttling sometimes also called throttle function is a practice used in websites. Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately.

Used for performance optimaztions or rate limit the function executions.

There are so many click event happening, when the function call happens at very first event (first click), throttling will delay next function call for a certain period of time and will happen after that period of time.

Problem Statement:
For window resize event, write a function using throttling concept.
Current window should get resized.
